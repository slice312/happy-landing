In a project using ES6 modules, so you can't just open the `index.html` file for you via the file system, you need to get the page from the local server.

## How to run
### Run server for development
```sh
npm start
```

### Run production build
By default starting on `http://localhost:3000`
```sh
npm run start-prod  
```
